# A simple chat app for iOS built using Swift

This app was created as a learning project with the primary goal of understanding how to use and integrate Firebase.
It is also the first "big" project I have worked on that incorporates networking. 


Here are some of the things I learned and added to the project:

- Facebook Login
- Google Sign In
- Firebase
  - Auth
  - Crashlytics
  - Realtime Database (Conversations & user data)
  - Storage (Profile pictures, images/videos sent in conversations)
- MessageKit
- Custom table cells / View Models
- More practice creating UI programmatically (and finding that I prefer it to storyboards)
- CoreLocation & MapKit to send locations on a map using annotations
- Practice with MVC architecture, this helped immensely in finding bugs/navigating code
- I am becoming MUCH more comfortable with using closures as I utilized completion handlers A LOT in this project. This is due to many pieces of a chat app needing to be asynchronous to run smoothly.
- Freaking out about committing my Firebase API key and realizing it's meant to be public :) :) :)
